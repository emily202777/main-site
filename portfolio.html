  <p>
    Last fall, my mom was diagnosed with late-stage, metastatic cancer, the morning she turned 50. The news came as a shock to my entire family. Our incredible, strong, thriving, ‘wonder woman’ had been silently suffering from a life-threatening disease.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was still a freshman, getting adjusted to a new, big school. All three of my sisters had moved out, and my Dad was constantly overworked at the hospital, so I had to take care of my Mom. Although she would always tell me what a big help I’d been, taking on her chores around the house, I felt so helpless.
  </p>

  <p>
    After a few months of doing the best I could to look after Mom, I felt I had to get more involved, having now seen what patients with cancer and their loved ones had to endure-- weeks of difficult treatment, praying for surgeries to go well, watching the life draining from their faces.
  </p>

  <p>
    My best friend, who I recognize now, had stepped up as my main support system during this time and informed me of an opportunity to run a cancer fundraising campaign through the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. We were eager to run together as co-candidates, and I hoped that by making an impact, I could return some hope to my own family.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the next few months, Prisha and I assembled a worldwide team of over thirty multigenerational members, all joining together under a single cause. Individually, we spent over one hundred hours devising and executing campaign activities, hosting team meetings, designing promotions, and pitching sponsorships to local businesses.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the cumulation of our campaign, we were able to raise over $20,000 in funding for our local patients’ treatments and transportation, alongside advocacy groups on Capitol Hill running their campaigns to garner greater federal support for cancer research.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, I am so grateful to have played a part in improving the lives of the hundreds of patients we were able to assist. Back at home, I am excited to report Mom is recovering quickly, though she still isn’t cancer-free. As she nears closer to remission, her new thick hair once again matching mine, I am finally beginning to understand my role in her treatment-- not the cure, but a support system.
